# Orginize the data

1. Create a version folder in data and model. In this example we create `v1`.
2. Put your labeled data (train/test/val) into the data/v1
3. In your v1 folder create a file called `labels.txt` and put your label names in there.
4. Go back into the main directory and run `orginize.py --version=v1`.
5. Done. Your data is now in the proper format.
